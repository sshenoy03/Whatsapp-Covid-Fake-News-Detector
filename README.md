# Whatsapp-Covid-Fake-News-Detector
Implemented SVM, Naive Bayes and LSTM logic using Tensorflow to detect fake news related to COVID-19 pandemic such as false government guidelines incorrect reporting of increase in cases, etc. LSTM showed accuracy of upto 80% on a test size of 5000 samples where model was trained on 20,000 samples.<br>
Training and test data was sourced from multiple sources such as UCI data repository, kaggle, datasets used for academic papers in similar domain, and various fact checking and news verification websites.<br>
